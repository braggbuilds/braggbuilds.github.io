    This app simplifies working out and provides meaningful feedback by measuring your total volume over time.
    Volume in this case is the product of reps, time under tension, and weight.
    All three of these factors are proportionate to the amount of work you perform during an exercise.
    Therefore, any time you increase one of these (reps/time/weight) from one workout to the next, you have increased the load.
    This is progressive overload, and it is the only way to make real gains.
    As you <i>progress</i> through your program, you want to increase the <i>load</i> of each exercise and workout.
    Strive for more, and you will eventually surpass your goals.
    Genius is, as simple does, and without consistency and continued dedication to the program, there will be no progressive overload, and therefore no gains.
    You gotta stay focused and just maintain the schedule for years while not letting up on trying to do more each time you hit the weights.
    You earn your strength by putting in the work day after day.
    It may not be much at the very beginning, but the longterm prospects of consistent work are similar to compounding interest.
    Real progress requires patience and determination.
    So long as you stay focused, your current goals will eventually become accomplishments that you can look back on to stay motivated in continuing to move further.

    Push pull legs is my preferred method of weight lifting.
    It just makes sense, doesn't it?
    Hitting every muscle group is the core to achieving any meaningful progress.
    With a push pull legs routine, you evenly distribute the load across each section/functionality.
</p>
<h3>Push.</h3>
<p>
    Push days are for your pushing muscles.
    Who knew?
    This includes the anterior deltoids, triceps, and pectoralis major.
</p>
<h5>Example routine: bench press, triceps press, overhead press.</h5>
<h3>Pull.</h3>
<p>
    In case you haven't recognized the pattern, pull days are for your pulling muscles.
    Mind blowing.
    This includes the biceps, posterior deltoids, trapezius, rhomboid, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and thoraco-lumbar fascia.
</p>
<h5>Example routine: deadlifts, bent over rows, bicep curls.</h5>
<h3>Legs.</h3>
<p>
    I'm not going to tell you what the legs workout does, a little homework exercise for ya.
</p>
<h5>Example routine: Squats, leg curls, calf raises.</h5>
<p>
    Interestingly, the leg exercises can be incorporated into the push and pull workouts.
    I don't think one method is necessarily better than the other because it's based on your personal preference.
    However, if you want to incorporate legs into the push and pull days without giving them their own day we can separate leg muscles into push and pull.
    squats are more of a push exercise, which target your quadriceps and glutes.
    Deadlifts are a pull exercise that greatly affect the hamstrings, so the hamstrings can be considered a pull muscle.
</p>
<h5>You forgot about Core!</h5>
<p>
    I never forget.
    Core is a supporting factor in every workout as are the forearms.
    The choice to target supporting muscles isn't necessary when you have a proper routine.
    If you perform a well rounded routine that hits all of the muscles above, you will inadvertently hit your supporting muscles just as well as the rest.
