<!--
introduction and transition to products list
-->
<p>
    I, Mark Bragg, am the owner of Bragg Builds LLC.
    I enjoy writing apps and helping others learn to create on their own.
    <br>
    I currently have one product in market:<br>
    <a href={{ site.url | append: "/collections/ppl/pplMain.html"}}>Push. Pull. Legs.</a>
</p>

<h3>Bells and Whistles</h3>
<p>
    I like to write simple apps that serve a sole purpose. For me, most apps do too much, and I find the extraneous
    features to be more burdensome than anything. To be honest, I don't like a large portion of apps simply because
    they're bloated with extra features.
</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>
    My apps have advertisements to support my business. If you want to get rid of the ads, I provide the ability to
    do so through a small transaction.
